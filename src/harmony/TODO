* weird blank spot on OptionSection due to z-index ordering
* next and prev button functions
* charcoal with gray (hard to get low latency updates, perhaps spray gray then black and white?)
* effect strength toggle in brush config dropdown
* separate brush config into two buttons
* script for testing (without installation)
* separate color areas that can be clicked?

NEXT:

* Box / Frame class for adding outlines
* Expander class: for packing then centering group? or should pack_center just take an array
* add battery percentage
* automatic reflow
* finish brushes + add more:
  * ribbon, circles, rectangles
* github releases

DESIRED FEATURES:

* save canvas to png (or notebooks)

* implement brushes
  * procedural: sketchy, chrome, shaded, etc
  * normal: pen, marker, etc

* undo / redo
* hideable toolbars
* variable stroke width (button that allows 3 widths + pressure sensitive)
* draw icons (instead of text)
* draw to canvas using wacom input
* add launcher from button press so app can be launched / quit
* add polished interactions
* layout that scales based on resolution
* multi layer canvas

DRAWING:

* draw bezier curves (instead of line) between consecutive points

EVENTS:

* handle multi touch events


APP:

* highlight dropdown box
* implement listbox widget
* implement brushes
  * squares
  * circles


TESTING:

* write simple app that draws a circle, rect or point when there are touch events

PERF:

* minimize amount of memory needed for undo/redo

DEV EXPERIENCE:

* have main app call viewer? (optional)

PUNT:

* put brushes into own dir
* show mouse in dev mode?
* write resize from scratch (play with different algos first?)
* multiple layers
* instruction list of strokes and so on
* selection tool (lasso?) + all it entails (copy, cut, rotate, etc?)
* stroke list (for saving replays) or just saving space
